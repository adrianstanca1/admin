---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If site doesn't load:

1. **Check DNS/URL**
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation
   - Try: http://access-5018479682.webspace-host.com

2. **Check SFTP Connection**
   ```bash
   lftp -u a1064628 sftp://access-5018479682.webspace-host.com
   ls
   ```

3. **Verify Files**
   - index.html should be in root
   - assets/ folder should exist

4. **Check .htaccess (if needed)**
   - May need SPA routing configuration
   - Redirect all routes to index.html

### If features don't work:

1. **API Connection Issues**
   - Check browser console
   - Verify API endpoints in .env.production
   - Check CORS settings

2. **Map Not Loading**
   - Check Leaflet loading
   - Verify geolocation permissions

3. **Login Not Working**
   - Check Supabase connection
   - Verify OAuth redirect URIs

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended):
1. ✅ Visit the site and test basic functionality
2. ✅ Check browser console for errors
3. ✅ Test on mobile devices
4. ✅ Verify login flow

### Optional (Enhancement):
1. **Custom Domain**: Point your domain to IONOS server
2. **SSL Certificate**: Ensure HTTPS is enabled
3. **Backend Setup**: If using custom backend API
4. **Monitoring**: Set up uptime monitoring
5. **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics or similar

### Configuration (If Needed):
1. **OAuth Redirect URIs**: Update in GitHub/Google consoles:
   - Add: `https://access-5018479682.webspace-host.com`
   
2. **CORS**: If API calls fail, update backend CORS:
   - Allow origin: `https://access-5018479682.webspace-host.com`

3. **Environment Variables**: If needed, redeploy with updated .env.production
