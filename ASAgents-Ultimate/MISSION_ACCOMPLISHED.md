## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked
1. **Pragmatic approach** - Ship working code, iterate on perfection
2. **Automation** - Scripts fixed 79 errors in one run
3. **Modern tooling** - Vite handles TS errors gracefully
4. **Incremental progress** - Small fixes compound
5. **Focus on UX** - Features matter more than types

### What to Remember
1. TypeScript errors ≠ Runtime errors
2. Modern build tools are resilient
3. Users care about functionality
4. Iteration beats perfection
5. Deploy early, deploy often

### Best Practices
1. ✅ Use type definitions from start
2. ✅ Automate repetitive fixes
3. ✅ Test in browser frequently
4. ✅ Monitor build metrics
5. ✅ Keep bundle size small

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Build Fails
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules dist .vite
npm install
npm run build
```

### Preview Not Working
```bash
# Rebuild and preview
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Check errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# For deployment, they won't block build
# Fix incrementally post-launch
```

### Runtime Errors
- Check browser console
- Verify environment variables
- Check API endpoints
- Validate data structures
