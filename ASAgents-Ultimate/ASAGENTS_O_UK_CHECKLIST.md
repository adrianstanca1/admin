./deploy-asagents-o-uk.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
```bash
# 1. Clean and build
rm -rf dist/ node_modules/.vite
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run build

# 2. Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod --yes

# 3. Configure domain
vercel domains add asagents.o.uk
```

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### 1. DNS Configuration
Add these records to your domain provider:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: asagents
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com

Type: CNAME
Name: www.asagents
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 2. Verification URLs
Test these endpoints after deployment:

- ‚úÖ **Main Site**: https://asagents.o.uk
- ‚úÖ **API Health**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/health
- ‚úÖ **Projects API**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/projects
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard API**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/analytics/dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/auth/login

### 3. Performance Verification

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Vercel Dashboard
- **Project URL**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Deployment History**: Track all deployments
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor speed and uptime
- **Error Tracking**: View runtime errors

### Analytics Endpoints
- **Health**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/health
- **Status**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/status
- **Metrics**: https://asagents.o.uk/api/metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Domain Not Accessible
- Check DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
- Verify DNS records are correct
- Ensure domain is added to Vercel project

#### 2. SSL Certificate Issues
- Wait for automatic provisioning (can take up to 1 hour)
- Check domain verification in Vercel dashboard
- Verify DNS records are pointing correctly

#### 3. API Endpoints Not Working
- Check CORS configuration
- Verify environment variables
- Test API endpoints individually

#### 4. Build Failures
- Clear node_modules and reinstall
- Check for TypeScript errors
- Verify all dependencies are compatible

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check deployment status
vercel ls

# View deployment logs
vercel logs

# Check domain status
vercel domains ls

# Verify build locally
npm run build && npm run preview
```

## Production Environment
