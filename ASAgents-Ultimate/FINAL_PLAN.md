## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Immediate Fixes Needed

#### 1. Type System Completion
```typescript
// Add to types.ts
export interface ComponentBaseProps {
  className?: string;
  style?: React.CSSProperties;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}

// Update API signatures
export interface APIOptions {
  signal?: AbortSignal;
  timeout?: number;
  retries?: number;
}
```

#### 2. API Layer Standardization
```typescript
// All API functions should follow this pattern
async function apiCall<T>(
  endpoint: string,
  options?: APIOptions
): Promise<T> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### 3. Component Props Alignment
```typescript
// Ensure all components have proper prop types
interface ComponentProps extends ComponentBaseProps {
  // Component-specific props
}
```

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Risks & Solutions

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| TypeScript errors persist | High | Low | Systematic fixing working |
| API integration issues | High | Medium | Mock API ready as fallback |
| Database connection fails | High | Low | Use Supabase managed service |
| Build fails in production | Medium | Low | Test build locally first |
| Performance issues | Medium | Medium | Code splitting & lazy loading |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Run security audit first |
